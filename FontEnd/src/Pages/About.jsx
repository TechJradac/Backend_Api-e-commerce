        Bart-Hannah enterprise has been in the system since the 90s. It used to
        be handled by one Mrs. Appiah in Takorade who is currently late but
        since she is no more, her son , Okatakyie Tee Appiah is now handling it.
        Tee is currently out of the country and has left the Bart-Hannah
        enterprise in the care of his project manager and they plan on
        relocating the enterprise to Accra. Even though, Bart-Hannah has been in
        the system for long, it lacks publicity when it comes to online stuff.
        As a result of that, they have chosen to come to an agreement with
        TechJradac to develop a web application software to advertise the
        business as far as they can. This done will help in the growth and
        development of the business.
